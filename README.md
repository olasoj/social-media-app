## Features

**The following functionalities are available in this application:**

- Users can log in to edit a post post if they are the authors of the post.

- Users can log in to delete a post post if they are the authors of the post.

- Users can create an account and receive a unique account id after signing up. When registering, the user must provide an account name that does not already exist on the platform.
