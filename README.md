## Features

**The following functionalities are available in this application:**

- Users can read post/comment list without authentication.

- Users can sign up to create post/comment.

- Users can log in to create a post/comment.

- Users can log in to edit a post/comment if they are the authors of the post/comment.

- Users can create an account and receive a unique account id after signing up. When registering, the user must provide a username and email that does not already exist on the platform.

- The username and password are used to authenticate the user, which results in the user receiving an access token if successful.

- Except for reading post(s) comment(s), login and registration, every request must have a valid access token.

- This system was built using the spring-boot framework with spring security, without Postgres database, and following the best principles in software engineering.
